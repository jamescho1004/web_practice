				An eight-time All-Star and All-NBA performer, two-time scoring champ, two-time league MVP, 2022 All-Star Game MVP and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Curry has solidified his place in league history as not only the greatest shooter of all-time but one of the greatest players of all-time.

				Simply put, Curry changed the way basketball is played. 
			</p>

			<p>
				He made the 3-point shot more popular than anyone that came before him, including his dad, Dell Curry, who played 16 years in the NBA, his final three seasons in Toronto with the Raptors.

				He opened the door for the next generation of guards who could use the 3-ball as their greatest weapon like Hawks guard Trae Young.
			</p>
			<p>
				Curry proved you don't have to be 7-foot tall or even 6-6 to dominate the NBA. 

				All you need is a shot.
