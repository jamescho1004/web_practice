		<h2>
			Curry has won many championships and MVP awards over the course of his career. 
			However, there has been much debate as to whether he is the best point guard.
			The player who was called the best point guard before Curry was Magic Johnson.
			Even now, many people say that Magic Johnson is the greatest point guard in NBA history and Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history.
			But Curry doesn't just have the ability to shoot. He has tremendous flexibility and an unbelievable field goal percentage, and when he gets the ball and attempts a driving layup, no matter how many players try to stop him, he is unstoppable. 
			In addition, he does not just receive passes from his teammates and shoot, but continuously runs around the court and creates various spaces, showing a wide vision and excellent passing play.
